Forkify is a JavaScript application that interacts with the food2fork API to fetch and display recipe food data. This app uses modern JavaScript tools, such as Webpack to bundle the modules, and Babel to convert ES6, ES7 and ES8 back to ES5. The user can search for a specific recipe, get directions on how to cook the recipe itself, add/remove ingredients to a shopping list or save recipes to a favourites list via local storage by clicking the heart icon.

This project was a tutorial from Jonas Schmedtmann's 'The Complete JavaScript Course' on Udemy.
